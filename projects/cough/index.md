## Help Test Our Cough Monitoring App!

<img src=/images/projects/cough_pic.jpg height="300">

Hi!

We are a team of researchers with the UW UbiComp Lab and we are researching a cough detection smartphone app.  You may have seen some of our publicity [here](https://www.washington.edu/news/2020/03/31/uw-researchers-need-your-digital-coughs/).

We are now seeking volunteers (healthy or with a cough) to help with testing. Testing is easy!  It should only take 2-3 minutes of setup time, then a 24-hour monitoring period.  And for your help, you'll receive a $15 Amazon Gift Card!

Here's how it works:

- You'll first download the cough monitoring app using a link we provide.

- Next, you'll complete a consent form administered through the app.

- You'll then start the cough monitoring and leave the app running for 24 hours.

- The app will automatically detect and upload sounds it thinks are coughs.

- You are free to disable the monitoring after the 24 hours are complete.

Interested in participating in the study? Please send an email to UWCoughTest@gmail.com letting us know you are interested.

Thanks in advance!
